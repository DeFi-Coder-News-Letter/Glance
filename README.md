## Contributing

Glance needs you! If you find bugs, have feature requests, or have other needs, please help out!

The best way to contribute is to start a new ticket, or to work on an existing ticket.

Once you have tested your changes and confirmed they work, send a pull request. Add yourself to the list of contributors below as well!

### Important note!

Please be sure to submit your pull requests to the _dev_ branch, rather than _master_. Since the currently deployed version depends on accessing the raw resources from Github master, all changes must be reviewed for functionality and security testing before they can be merged directly. Thank you!
